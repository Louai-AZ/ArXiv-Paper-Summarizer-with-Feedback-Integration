# ArXiv-Paper-Summarizer-with-Feedback-Integration

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to input an arXiv paper ID (or link) and get a summary generated using a language model. The summarization process is interactive, with the ability for users to provide feedback on the summary. This feedback helps improve the summarizer over time.

The system is built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **Langsmith** and **HuggingFace** models, with the ability to pull papers from **arXiv** and dynamically summarize them based on user input.

## Key Features

- 📥 Fetch papers from **arXiv** using paper ID or link.
- 🧠 Summarize the content..
- 👍👎 Let users rate the summary and save feedback for model improvement.
- 💬 Supports prompt updating and feedback-based optimization.

## How to Use

1. **Enter the Paper ID**  
   On the main page, paste an arXiv ID (e.g., `2404.12345`) or a full arXiv paper URL into the input box.

2. **View the Summary**  
   After entering the paper ID or link, the system will fetch the paper and generate a summary.

3. **Provide Feedback**
   - 👍 **Like the suggestion**: Click the thumbs-up button to save the modified summary as an approved example.
   - 👎 **Dislike the suggestion**: Click the thumbs-down button or respond to the chatbot with your requested changes.
   - ✏️ **Modify if needed**: If the suggestion is close but needs tweaks, edit the summary directly in the text box before clicking 👍.

   > ⚠️ **Note**: Once you click either **👍** or **👎**, the conversation ends, and the bot will no longer respond in that session.

4. **Reset the Session**  
   To start a new conversation, click the "Reset" button or refresh your browser.

5. **Learning from Feedback**  
   The application will learn from your feedback and adapt future suggestions accordingly.
